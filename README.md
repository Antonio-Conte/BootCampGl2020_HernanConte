# BootCampGl2020_HernanConte

This is a wish list:
- I want to take my mother to Tucuman.
- I want to buy myself a computer.
- I want pizza
- Stuff
- This is a more recent change. Checking if the commands of git are the same in Linux and Windows. At first hand, there 
are NO difference between them. Wait for future reports.
